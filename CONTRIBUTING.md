## Code of Conduct

This project and everyone participating in it is governed by the CSDMS [Code of Conduct](./CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md). By participating, you are expected to uphold this code.

## Bug Reports

Bugs are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://guides.github.com/features/issues/).
A great way to contribute is to send a detailed issue when you encounter a problem.

Before [creating an issue](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/creating-an-issue), check that you are using the latest version of the project; if not, see if updating fixes your issue.

To submit a good bug report, explain the problem and include additional details to help the maintainers reproduce the problem:

* Use a clear and descriptive title for the issue to identify the problem.
* Describe the steps which reproduce the problem, including as many details as possible.
* Provide specific examples to demonstrate the steps. Include links to files. If you're providing code snippets in the issue, use [Markdown code blocks](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github#multiple-lines).
* Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps and point out what exactly is the problem with that behavior. Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.

Include details about your configuration and environment:

* The name and version of your operating system.
* Any details about your local setup that might be helpful in troubleshooting.
