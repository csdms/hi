This repository contains files for use across repositories
in the [CSDMS][csdms] project.

Files include:

* [CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md](./CODE-OF-CONDUCT.md): Describes expected behavior to be followed when participating in a project
* [CONTRIBUTING.md](./CONTRIBUTING.md): Gives guidelines for contributing to a project

These files are intended to be universal--they can be linked to,
or their contents can be copy-pasted into an equivalent document
in another repository.

This repository is also the host for the [CSDMS Forum][discussions].
